    It’s an annual puff piece, whoever is in charge of security at the Super
    Bowl appears on the news in front of some barrier or computer screen,

It’s an annual puff piece, whoever is in charge of security at the Super
Bowl appears on the news in front of some barrier or computer screen,
talking about the number of security guards, guard dogs, or whatever
else passes as some grand measure of the ‘amount’ of security being
applied.

the game simply by acting like they belonged, a news feature on Super
Bowl XLVIII shows why bragging about your security can backfire:

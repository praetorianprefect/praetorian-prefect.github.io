Internet Explorer can be caused to allow remote code execution.
Earlier today this entry from yesterday at Wepawet (an online analysis
engine for malware) was pointed out to H.D. Moore, and within hours
Metasploit has an exploit of the vulnerability integrated. McAfee has
confirmed that the exploit is out and the same one they saw during the
investigation. The video below demonstrates how crackers initially
gained access to the corporate networks of Google, et al. using this
zero day attack.

## Here It Is

The video below demonstrates how Google and the rest have been,
according to most news reports, exploited via the "Aurora" vulnerability
in Internet Explorer, and had their "intellectual property" taken.

[The "Aurora" IE Exploit in Action][1] from [The Crew of Praetorian Prefect][2] on [Vimeo][3].

In the video you will see Metasploit set up a listening session, set
up a web site that serves up the malicious code, and watch as an
unsuspecting user visits the web site, triggers the attack that uses
the IE vulnerability, and unknowingly opens a connection to a computer
owned by the attacker. The attacker then lists the user’s processes,
and elects to kill Notepad where the user was working on an important
document. IE 6.0 is used, as this is the version Microsoft references as
having been used in the "targeted attacks" on some 30+ U.S. companies.

A silly example for demonstration to be sure, but once the backdoor is
open to the user’s PC the attacker can use it as a pivot point for other
attacks against the internal network, escalate his or her privileges,
take information off the PC, basically do anything the user can do.

## The Vector

The attack scenario is that users were pointed to a web site (probably
through a targeted Spam e-mail, an attack called spear phishing)
containing a JavaScript that references this invalid pointer and injects
the included shell code. The code below was released publicly yesterday.

## Update

* Ahmed Obied has published a clean python version of the exploit
  (opens your Windows Calculator) for testing, search: ie_aurora.py
* CVE-2010-0249 has been opened for this issue

## Finally

> “At this time, we are aware of limited, active attacks attempting
> to use this vulnerability against Internet Explorer 6. We have not
> seen attacks against other affected versions of Internet Explorer.”

> –Microsoft.

This situation has the potential to change rapidly now that it appears
the exploit has been found. Microsoft last patched a vulnerability off
cycle in July of 2009, they could elect to pursue the same response
here.

Or as McAfee's Craig Schmugar correctly opines: 

> "What started out as a sophisticated targeted attack is likely to lead to large-scale attacks on vulnerable Microsoft Internet Explorer users."

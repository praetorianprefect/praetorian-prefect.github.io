In my last OSSEC post [OSSEC: Agentless to save the day](/archives/2009/11/ossec-agentless-to-save-the-day/) I went over how
to setup agentless monitoring using the built in scripts. With this post
I am going to get into the details of how to modify the OSSEC supplied
scripts to do your bidding.

## Agentless Scripts {#agentless_scripts}

All scripts that work with OSSEC agentless security monitoring use
`stdout` for communication and reporting to the OSSEC server. This makes
writing scripts for OSSEC simple as you do not need to do anything more
then print or echo to `stdout`. The format of the output does need to
meet the OSSEC specification, but that is a very simple thing to do.

Before we move to the specification details I need to explain that OSSEC
agentless runs to different types of scripts. Namely the following:

Type          | Description 
--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
periodic_diff | Scripts output data to the OSSEC agentless process that will then be compared to past runs and if there are differences an OSSEC alert will be generated. 
periodic      | Scripts output controlled messages to the OSSEC agentless process that will then be processed accordingly. 

#### Periodic diff Specification {#agentless_scripts_periodic_diff}

The output for periodic_diff is very simple, any and all output after
the agentless command "`STORE: now`" and before the next OSSEC Command
will be stored and compared for differences. This type of script is
mostly used for hardware devices such as Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, and
other products.

Scripts that use the `periodic_diff` make use of the following commands:

Command | Description 
--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INFO:   | The string following INFO will be logged to `/var/ossec/logs/ossec.log` by OSSEC for debugging.  
ERROR:  | Error needs to be reported.  The string following this command is forwarded to the OSSEC manager, and the OSSEC process closes down the script. 
STORE:  | All the lines that follows this command will be added stored and compared to previous runs of the script 

Here is an example of a periodic_diff script that comes with OSSEC.
(_Please note with all agentless scripts you must be in the root of the
OSSEC install for them to function correctly_.)

```bash
obsd46#( cd /var/ossec && ./agentless/ssh_pixconfig_diff cisco@172.17.0.1 'show hardware' )

```

In this example above the script would store the contents between
"`STORE: now`" and "`INFO: Finished.`". If this is the first time that
OSSEC agentless has run this command no alerts would be generated and
the contents would have been saved for later comparisons. If OSSEC
agentless has a stored copy from a previous execution it will compare
the files and if there are any differences it will generate an alert.

#### Periodic Specification  {#agentless_scripts_periodic}

The periodic specification has more options and gives more control to
the script writer on what actions OSSEC will take. Once again `stdout`
is used for communication so script writing is easy.

Command | Description 
--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INFO:   | The string following INFO will be logged to `/var/ossec/logs/ossec.log` by OSSEC for debugging.  
ERROR:  | Error needs to be reported.  The string following this command is forwarded to the OSSEC manager, and the OSSEC process closes down the script. 
FWD:    | The string following FWD is a colon delimited list of stats on a given file.  

Example of real `FWD:` command.

```
FWD: 19419:600:0:0:fb30de5b02029950ae05885a3d407c8c:017cd6118cdc166ee8eba8af1b7fdad6763203d3 ./.bash_history
```

The Fields break down in to the following 

Field   | Description 
--------|--------------------------------------------------------------
`FWD: ` | The OSSEC Command 
`19419` | Total size of file, in bytes 
`600`   | Access rights of file in octal
`0`     | User ID of file owner 
`0`     | Group ID of file owner
`fb30de5b02029950ae05885a3d407c8c` | MD5 Hash of file 
`017cd6118cdc166ee8eba8af1b7fdad6763203d3` | SHA1 Hash of file 
./.bash_history | Path and name of file 

Using this format OSSEC can store the information about a file and then
in the future run compare that they are the same. If for some reason
they are not the same an alert will be generated. Here is an example of
a password change on a linux system:

```bash

## Agentless Script: ssh_integrity_check_linux {#ssh_integrity_check_linux}

Now that we have an understanding of how agentless scripts communicate
with the parent OSSEC preocess, let's move on to a working example. The
OSSEC supplied script `ssh_integrity_check_linux` is a great place to
start, so lets open it up and see what is going on.

```expect
obsd46# cat /var/ossec/agentless/ssh_integrity_check_linux
 #!/usr/bin/env expect

 # @(#) $Id: ssh_integrity_check_linux,v 1.11 2009/06/24 17:06:21 dcid Exp $
 # Agentless monitoring

 # Foundation.


 # Main script.
source "agentless/main.exp"


 # SSHing to the box and passing the directories to check.
if [catch {
    spawn ssh $hostname
} loc_error] {
    send_user "ERROR: Opening connection: $loc_error.\n"
    exit 1;
}


source $sshsrc
source $susrc

set timeout 600
send "echo \"INFO: Starting.\"; for i in `find $args 2>/dev/null`;do tail \$i >/dev/null 2>&1 && 
md5=`md5sum \$i | cut -d \" \" -f 1` && sha1=`sha1sum \$i | cut -d \" \" -f
 1` && echo FWD: `stat --printf \"%s:%a:%u:%g\" \$i`:\$md5:\$sha1 \$i; done; exit\r"
send "exit\r"

expect {
    timeout {
        send_user "ERROR: Timeout while running commands on host: $hostname .\n"
        exit 1;
    }
    eof {
        send_user "\nINFO: Finished.\n"
        exit 0;
    }
}

exit 0;
```

The comments in the script hints to what is going on, but everything up
to and including `set timeout 600` is related to setting up the `expect`
functions and code for handling the `ssh` subprocess and connecting to
the remote host. I am not going to spend any time with this section, I
am just going to make use of it.

The meat of what is getting processed on the remote end all happens in
two lines.

```bash
send "echo \"INFO: Starting.\"; for i in `find $args 2>/dev/null`;do tail \$i >/dev/null 2>&1 && 
md5=`md5sum \$i | cut -d \" \" -f 1` && sha1=`sha1sum \$i | cut -d \" \" -f
 1` && echo FWD: `stat --printf \"%s:%a:%u:%g\" \$i`:\$md5:\$sha1 \$i; done; exit\r"
send "exit\r"
```

Let's break this down to see what is happening. 

The `send` command pushes the following string to the ssh subprocess
which gets run on the remote end of the connection. Before the script is
sent to the remote host `expect` internally processes the string. This
includes searching for variables and removing any control characters.

The control characters are first taken into account, and in the case
of our example all escaped special characters are processed. `\"`,
`\r`, and `\$` would be replaced with `"`, "`carriage return`", and `&`
respectively. The reason the escape characters are needed so that they
will not interfere with `expects` own string processing and control. We
will need to handle control characters in this way when we begin writing
our own script.

While special characters were being handled by `expect` it also
looked for variables to replace, in this case it will find `$args`
and replace it with what ever arguments were passed to the script
by the OSSEC agentless process. If we specified the following in
`/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` the `$args` variable would be replaced with
"`/bin /etc /sbin`".

```bash
  <agentless>
    <type>ssh_integrity_check_linux</type>
    <frequency>3600</frequency>
    <host>root@172.17.20.20</host>
    <state>periodic</state>
    <arguments>/bin /etc /sbin</arguments>
  </agentless>
``` 

Back to the commands that get run. Once `expect` has completed
replacement we are left with this command.

```bash
echo "INFO: Starting."; for i in `find /bin /etc /sbin 2>/dev/null`;do tail $i >/dev/null 2>&1 && 
md5=`md5sum $i | cut -d " " -f 1` && sha1=`sha1sum $i | cut -d " " -f
 1` && echo FWD: `stat --printf "%s:%a:%u:%g" $i`:$md5:$sha1 $i; done; exit
exit
```

This script then goes and uses the Unix `find` command to locate all
files in the specified path (from the arguments passed) and generates
an OSSEC `FWD: ` command for each one and prints it to `stdout`. Making
use of the commands `stat`, `md5sum`, and `sha1sum` to generate the data
needed. Here is an example of the output checking.

```bash

## Our own Agentless Script: ssh_dmz_linux {#ssh_dmz_linux}

Using the built in OSSEC agentless scripts are great, but sometimes
we need more focused scanning and checking. So let's modify the
`ssh_integrity_check_linux` for our environment.

The goals for this new script will be to watch for changes to files
based on the following criteria:

* All setuid and setgid files
* All files related to authentication (including .htaccess and ssh files)
* All application specific files (apache, ssh)

#### Finding all setuid and setgid files {#finding_setuid_setgid}

Let's first start by identifying a method to locate all files with
their setuid or setgid bits enabled. To do this we will ssh to the host
`172.17.20.20` and use `find` to locate the files.

```bash
obsd46# sudo -u ossec ssh root@172.17.20.20
[linux26 ~]# find / -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) 
/sbin/umount.nfs
/sbin/netreport
/sbin/unix_chkpwd
/sbin/mount.nfs
/sbin/pam_timestamp_check
/sbin/mount.nfs4
/sbin/umount.nfs4
/bin/ping6
/bin/su
/bin/umount
/bin/ping
/bin/mount
/lib/dbus-1/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/libexec/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/libexec/utempter/utempter
/usr/sbin/usernetctl
/usr/sbin/postqueue
/usr/sbin/userhelper
/usr/sbin/userisdnctl
/usr/sbin/postdrop
/usr/sbin/suexec
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/locate
/usr/bin/wall
/usr/bin/sudoedit
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/lockfile
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/write
/usr/bin/screen
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/chage
/usr/bin/sperl5.8.8
/usr/bin/crontab
/usr/bin/ssh-agent
``` 

#### Finding all files related to authentication and applications specific files {#finding_app_files}

Finding all files with setuid and setgid was simple, but finding all
files related to authentication is more invloved. This of course will
vary from system to system, but this should be good starting point.

```bash
obsd46# sudo -u ossec ssh root@172.17.20.20
[linux26 ~]# find / \( -name ".ssh" -o -name "ssh" -o -name "sshd" -o -name "httpd" -o -name ".htaccess"

#### Merging finds {#merging_finds}

Now we have two basic `find` methods that identify the files we want to
monitor for changes, but our finds were a little greedy so we should
create a way to strip out unwanted files from the list. As this is a
unix system `egrep` is the king for finding or removing items from a
list. To simplify things we can use `egrep` with the `-v` command line
argument which tells `egrep` **NOT** to print any matching items.

Just to make sure that we do not end up double processing files we
can make use of the `sort` command with `-u` argument to remove any
duplicates.

Here is how we would put together both `find`s, `egrep`, and `sort` to
locate and filter what is needed.

```bash
(find / -type f \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) && \find / \( -name ".ssh" -o -name "ssh" -o -name "sshd" 
-o -name "httpd" -o -name ".htaccess" -o -name "pam.d" \) -exec find {} \; ) 2>/dev/null | egrep 
-v "known_hosts|moduli|var\/log|var\/lock" | sort -u
```

The above command we have found all files and paths that we would like
to monitor, but this still needs to be integrated into a script on the
OSSEC server.

## Creating ssh_dmz_linux {#creating_ssh_dmz_linux}

We don't want to make changes to `ssh_integrity_check_linux` directly so
we will need to make a copy.

```bash
obsd46# (cd /var/ossec/agentless && cp ssh_integrity_check_linux ssh_dmz_linux)
```

Integrating our new command line into the script we must pay close
attention to special characters that `expect` will process. Due to this
we will need to escape all `/` and `"` by proceeding them with `\`. Once
we are done escaping we just insert our new line in place of `find $args
2>/dev/null` in our new file.

Here is what the completed script will look like. 

```expect
obsd56# cat /var/ossec/agentless/ssh_dmz_linux
 #!/usr/bin/env expect

do tail \$i >/dev/null 2>&1 && md5=`md5sum \$i | cut -d \" \" -f 1` && sha1=`sha1sum \$i | cut -d \" \" 
-f 1` && echo FWD: `stat --printf \"%s:%a:%u:%g\" \$i`:\$md5:\$sha1 \$i; done; exit\r"
send "exit\r"

expect {
    timeout {
        send_user "ERROR: Timeout while running commands on host: $hostname .\n"
        exit 1;
    }
    eof {
        send_user "\nINFO: Finished.\n"
        exit 0;
    }
}

exit 0;
```

#### Testing {#testing_ssh_dmz_linux}

Before we add this new script to OSSEC configuration we need to test it.

```bash
obsd46# (cd /var/ossec && sudo -u ossec ./agentless/ssh_dmz_linux root@172.17.20.20 )

ERROR: ssh_integrity_check <hostname> <arguments>
```

Due to not making use of the of the `$arg` variable in the way that
`ssh_integrity_check_linux` wants use too, this caused this the problem
above. Solving this problem would require making changes to files that
will effect other built in scripts. So a quick solution is to just pass
anything as an argument to the script. This will have no effect on our
script as we do not make use of the `$arg` variable.

```bash
obsd46# (cd /var/ossec && sudo -u ossec ./agentless/ssh_dmz_linux root@172.17.20.20 NOTUSED)
spawn ssh root@172.17.20.20

#### Going live {#going_live}

We have created a new OSSEC agentless script
and I am going to enable this script using the
[ossec-hids-tools](http://bitbucket.org/jrossi/ossec-hids-tools/) that
I introduced in my last post about ossec 
([OSSEC: Agentless to save the day](/archives/2009/11/ossec-agentless-to-save-the-day/)). Also a
restart of OSSEC will also be needed for the changes to take effect.

```bash
obsd46# ossec-config --section agentless --add --host root@172.17.20.20 --type ssh_dmz_linux 
--state periodic --argv "NOTUSED"
obsd46# /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control restart                                                   (root@jcli-1:/var/ossec)

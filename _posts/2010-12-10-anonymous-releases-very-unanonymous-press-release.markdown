## Full Press Release Text

> ANON OPS: A Press Release December 10, 2010
>
> Who is Anonymous In their most recent public statement, WikiLeaks is
> the only group of people to identify Anonymous correctly. Anonymous is
> not a group, but rather an Internet gathering.
>
> Both Anonymous and the media that is covering it are aware of the
> percieved dissent between individuals in the gathering. This does not,
> however, mean that the command structure of Anonymous is failing for
> a simple reason: Anonymous has a very loose and decentralized command
> structure that operates on ideas rather than directives.
>
> We do not believe that a similar movement exists in the world today
> and as such we have to learn by trial and error. We are now in the
> process of better communicating some core values to the individual
> atoms that comprise Anonymous – we also want to take this opportunity
> to communicate a message to the media, so that the average Internet
> Citizen can get to know who we are and what we represent.
>
> Anonymous is not a group of hackers. We are average Interent Citizens
> ourselves and our motivation is a collective sense of being fed up
> with all the minor and major injustices we witness every day.
>
> We do not want to steal your personal information or credit card
> numbers. We also do not seek to attack critical infrastructure of
> companies such as Mastercard, Visa, PayPal or Amazon. Our current goal
> is to raise awareness about WikiLeaks and the underhanded methods
> employed by the above companies to impair WikiLeaks’ ability to
> function.
>
> What is Operation: Payback As stated above, the point of Operation:
> Payback was never to target critical infrastructure of any of the
> companies or organizations affected. Rather than doing that, we
> focused on their corporate websites, which is to say, their online
> “public face”. It is a symbolic action – as blogger and academic
> Evgeny Morozov put it, a legitimate expression of dissent.
>
> The background to the attacks on PayPal and the calls to attack
> Amazon.com Amazon, which was until recently WikiLeaks’ DNS provider,
> was one of the first companies to drop support for WikiLeaks. On
> December 9th, BusinessInsider.com reported that Amazon.co.uk were
> hosting the recently leaked diplomatic cables in e-book form.
> (Amazon.co.uk has since ceased selling the bundle of the diplomatic
> cables.)
>
> After this piece of news circulated, parts of Anonymous on Twitter
> asked for Amazon.com to be targetted. The attack never occured.
>
> While it is indeed possible that Anonymous may not have been able to
> take Amazon.com down in a DDoS attack, this is not the only reason the
> attack never occured. After the attack was so advertised in the media,
> we felt that it would affect people such as consumers in a negative
> way and make them feel threatened by Anonymous. Simply put, attacking
> a major online retailer when people are buying presents for their
> loved ones, would be in bad taste.
>
> The continuing attacks on PayPal are already tested and preferable:
> while not damaging their ability to process payments, they are
> successful in slowing their network down just enough for people to
> notice and thus, we achieve our goal of raising awareness.
